Here we'll cover how to get started with Arduino
for the NURobotics Intro Class.

The following documentation can be used to read
more about specifics of getting started with Arduino:

The Arduino IDE is a very common IDE(Integrated Developer Environment) for coding with Arduino.
If you are interested in using another IDE such as VSCode, here is a useful link:

Arduino programming is done in C++, along with many libraries
that help you use various sensors/motors/etc. We can include 
libraries incredibly easily in the Arduino IDE by using the
'include' keyword like so:
#include <LibraryName.h>

The .h at the end of the Library denotes that it is a
'header' file, which is a file written in C++ that includes
declarations and setup for a Library or Class.

// Setup Function
void setup() {
    // This function runs once upon starting the program
    // We'll define variables and setup Inputs/Outputs here
}

// Loop Function
void loop() {
    // This function loops over again and runs the code
    // within the function forever
    // LED Blink, without delay, using the millis timer
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, millis() % 512 > 256);
